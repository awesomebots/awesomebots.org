# Welcome to Awesomebots!

We're a group of makers, hackers, artists, designers, etc... that are working to help each other build awesome bots! The site is a forum to ask questions, a collection of how-to's to share bots we've built and how to build them yourself, and a store where we can sell kits, t-shirts, and other such bric-a-brac to support the growth and develpment of the group! Yay to you for being here!  

## But what exactly is is a bot? And when is it awesome?

Well, I think that a bot has to have been built; it isn't anything grown or made via some sort of organic or chemical process. I think that a bot has to *do* something; generally using electricity to do it, and in response to something else. Is it a robot? I don't think so, because I think of a robot as having a body, whereas a bot can be just code; think chatbot or clickbot.
